            <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>Blini are small bite-sized pancakes, usually made from buckwheat, but all-purpose flour works just as well, and usually topped with a creme-fraiche, or even smoked salmon. A super easy, and tasty way to start your day!</p>

            <h3>Ingredients required:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour.</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder.</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup milk.</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons milk.</li>
                    <1i>1 large egg.</1i>
                    <li>1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter.</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3>Steps to make blini:</h3>
                <ol>First combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl.</ol>
                <ol>Then whisk 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, egg, and 1 tablespoon milted butter together in a seperate bowl. Mix into the flour mixture until the batter is fully combined.</ol>
                <ol>Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cooking several blini at a time, drop batter, one tablespoon at a time, onto the heated skillet. Cook until bubbles form, 1 1/2 to minutes. Flip and continue cooking until brown, about 1 minute more. Move to a paper towel-lined plate to help soak up excess butter.</ol>
                <ol> Repeat this process as much as desired with remaining batter.</ol>
