# odin-recipes

-In this project, I hope to implement what I've learned so far through the foundations course from The Odin Project's introduction to fullstack design.

The intent and goal is to demonstrate a firm grasp of the basics of HTML, and make a simple/easy to navigate website displaying cooking/baking recipes.
